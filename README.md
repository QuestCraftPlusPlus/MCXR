A VR mod for Minecraft using OpenXR and fabric.

# *Installation*
## For VR Players
Fetch the latest version of MCXR Core and Play from https://modrinth.com/mod/mcxr-play and https://modrinth.com/mod/mcxr-core and put them in the fabric mods folder. 
<br/>
For an in game title screen also install and set up a compatible version of https://github.com/Sorenon/TitleWorlds
## For Servers and Non-VR Players
MCXR is compatible with Vanilla servers and players but for the full experience install MCXR Core from https://modrinth.com/mod/mcxr-core

# *Known Issues*
Vive Pro controllers are not yet supported <br/>
No way to rebind controls without SteamVR</br>
SteamVR on Linux crashes due to poor OpenXR implementation, this can be mitigated with an [OpenXR Layer](https://github.com/Sorenon/sorenon_openxr_layer)
